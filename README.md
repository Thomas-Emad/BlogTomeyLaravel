## About BlogTomeyLaravel

The idea of the project is simply that it is a blog where anyone can post articles as a form of disseminating knowledge. The site is in Roles so that the admin or owner can add people to help him with moderation. Anyone who uploads an article can see the statistics for his own articles, and can control the articles. (GRUD Operations).
Website multi-language {Arabic, English}
The site is responsive because I use the Valex dashboard and edit it.

- I used Build in Dashboard [Valex](https://www.spruko.com/demo/valex).
- I For Auth [Laravel UI](https://github.com/laravel/ui).
- Can Learn Multi-Lang how work from [here](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/localization) 

I would like to get your opinion, my friend, on the site in terms of search, because I use the search and reading history to bring you suggested articles and cool stuff. I would like to know your opinion of the site as a whole.
